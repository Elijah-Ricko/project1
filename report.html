  <p style="margin:100px; font-size: 1.3em;">
    I believe my website meets all of the requirements needed for the assignment.  Firstly the website is accessible via both http and https. I followed the instructions given for that so, and I was able to do both without problem.  Next, I have a header with a navigation menu. I personally am quite pleased with how that turned out. Within the navigation menu contains the 5 required pages. Each of those pages indeed follow a shared style found in style.css. Most pages had extra style needing for different elements which is found in other css files. I have semi distinct layouts for smaller screens. I have a media query change the navigation bar to a burger menu and the 4 picture links on the main menu change orientation.  All of my files are also organized and validated appropriately. All other style specifications have been met as well to my knowledge.
