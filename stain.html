      <p>Staining a piece of wood is a relatively straight forward process. With that being said, if you don't follow the proper steps, your project may not turn out as you may hope. Here, we'll walk through some of the basic steps to make sure the result of your stain looks as good as possible.</p>

      <h2>When to Stain</h2>

      <p>Depending on the project, you may want to apply the stain before or after assembly. Your result won't differ on this decision, but it's more to make the process easier for you. In my experience, if there are a lot of interior angles or areas that lay on the floor that need stain, it may be easier to stain beforehand. Otherwise, there is no real need to stain before assembly, and it will be fine to stain afterwards.</p>

      <h2>What You Need</h2>

      <p>There are more items you'll need then just stain to ensure that the application goes as well as possible. Here's a list of some helpful products:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Pre-Stain Wood Conditioner</li>
        <li>Tack Cloth</li>
        <li>Rag</li>
        <li>Paint Brush</li>
        <li>Sand Paper</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Preparing the Wood</h2>

      <p>The first thing you should do is sand the wood you will be staining. This ensures the surface is flat and suitable for staining. Once done sanding, use a tack cloth to remove any leftover dust. This will prevent any stray particles getting trapped in the stain leaving an imperfect surface.</p>

      <p>Next, you will most often want to apply a Pre-Stain Wood Conditioner with a rag. This product preps the wood by seeping in the pores before the stain can. If the stain were to get in the pores, the result would look blotchy and uneven. Going the extra mile with Wood Conditioner always leaves your result looking more evenly absorbed.</p>

      <h2>Staining</h2>

      <p>Now, we get to the application of the wood stain. There are two main approaches to this: a rag or a brush. I have found that a rag is much easier to control, but brushes can help with tight corners. First, you pour the stain onto the wood, then spread the stain out with your tool of choice until it completely covers the area. You should leave the stain for 5 to 10 minutes before wiping. The longer you let it sit, the darker it makes the wood. Once you've waited, wipe off all the excess with a separate rag. Repeat this process for at least 3 coats. Remember to lightly sand the surface in between coats.</p>

      <h2>Finishing</h2>

      <p>Finishing is the process of adding a protective clear top coat to the surface of your project. This step is techniquely unnecessary, but it's good practice. There are multiple types of finishes you can apply: Polyurethane, Varnish, Shellac, and Laquer. All of these have the same basic steps as applying stain. The only difference is you will want to apply to the surface going with the grain where with stain, it didn't matter the direction. You will want two or three coats of this as well.</p>
