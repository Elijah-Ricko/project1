        Tools
      </h1>

      <p>Regardless of what tools you have access to, you can complete almost any project you want to make. A lot of tools are made to fast-track certain steps that are much more tedious to complete. For example, an Impact Driver is essentially a faster and more efficient screw driver. You can accomplish the same task with both, just the Impact Driver will speed up the job. Below, we'll discuss a lot of tools that accomplish the same task, just with more efficiency than other tools.</p>

      <h2>Fastening Tools</h2>

      <p>Fastening tools are some of the most common tools you'll see any woodworker have. They are essential for applying any fastener to your project. Below is a list of some common examples:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Hammer</li>
        <li>Screw Driver</li>
        <li>Wrench</li>
        <li>Nail Gun</li>
        <li>Staple Gun</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Now, a lot of these examples are generalizations of multiple tools (i.e. Hammer: {Hammer, Mallet} or Screw Driver: {Screw Driver, Drill, Impact Driver}). Which tool you use will be determined by what you need the tool for. A mallet will be less likely to damage the surface you're striking.  If that is a concern, best go with a mallet. A hammer can more or less be used otherwise. A drill vs an impact driver is more semantic. Realistically, both can be used to accomplish the same tasks. The difference in design is that a drill is used for drill holes while impact drivers are used to drive a screw or bolt into a hole or material. Like previously said, they both can accomplish these tasks, but impact drivers have more torque allowing them to apply more force than a drill can.</p>

      <h2>Saws</h2>

      <p>There are many specialized saws on the market. They all boil down to splitting something in have. Some examples include a Rip Saw, Hack Saw, Bow Saw, and Crosscut Saw. They difference between them mostly deals with what material you are cutting. Most of the time for woodworking, you'll want to use a rip saw, but the others are perfectly fine as well.</p>

      <p>Now, there are alot of electric saws as well that have many specialized uses. The most common examples include a Circular Saw, Jigsaw, Mitre Saw, and a Table Saw. These tools are great alternatives to the hand saws because they take much less effort to operate. They also make repetitive cuts much easier to repeat. Table saws and Mitre saws are especially useful in that scenario. Uniquely, Jigsaws allow you to cut round and curvy cuts. All the others are designed mainly for straight cuts, but Jigsaws allow you to cut very complex shapes with ease.</p>

      <p>Many projects will require you to use many different tools to make the process easier and more intuitive to do. There is no one tool to solve any problem, so you can use any amount of tools you can access to create the projects of your choosing. You can browse on <a href="https://www.homedepot.com">Home Depot</a> or <a href="https://www.lowes.com">Lowes</a> to see a wide variety of tools you may have not even known existed. it's nice to have as many tools as possible, try to get the most out of every tool you have and build your skills with them.</p>
