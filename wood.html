        Types of Wood
      </h1>

      <p>There are a lot of decisions that play into which species of wood you should choose for a project. You need to think about if you should use a  Hardwood vs Softwood, and if it is to be stained or painted.  These decisions all boil down to what look and feel will be best for this project.  While there are some characteristics that can help guide your decision, it comes down to personal preference. Below, there will be a breakdown of those characteristics to assist the decision making.</p>

      <h2>Hardwood vs Softwood</h2>

      <p>Hardwood is a very strong type of wood. It is a great choice for projects like furniture, flooring, construction, and musical instruments. Some examples of Hardwood include Oak, Maple, and Walnut. Also, due to their superior strength and durability, hardwood is generally more expensive than softwood. Although, that cost may be worth it if your project needs to be strong and long-lasting.</p>

      <p>Contrary to their name, Softwoods are not as weak as you may think. They are still plenty strong though generally not as strong as Hardwood. This is usually due to the fact the they grow at a faster rate than Hardwoods, therefore becoming less dense. Softwoods are great for a lot of interior purposes. They are often used for interior moulding, windows, frames. </p>

      <h2>Stainable vs Paintable</h2>

      <p>There are some species of wood that react better to stain than others. If a species does not take stain well, it is considered a "paint-grade" wood. Meaning, that species is better off being painted. Now, there are ways to make wood take stain better, but that will be discussed on the <a href="stain.html">stain</a> page.  Below are species that are considered "paint-grade": </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Poplar</li>
        <li>Maple</li>
        <li>Alder</li>
        <li>Birch</li>
        <li>Pine</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Here are some examples of stainable wood:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Oak</li>
        <li>Ash</li>
        <li>Cedar</li>
        <li>Chestnut</li>
      </ul>
